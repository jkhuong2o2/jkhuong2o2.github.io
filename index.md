### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was one of the labs that I enjoyed coding. The lab was simple which allowed
    me to ease myself into C++. The program was about assigning what the user says to an
    ingredient and combining all the ingredients/variables as one like a sandwich.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was an interesting lab because it was about blackjack. I was always
    interested in blackjack but never really understood what happens until now. For this 
    assignment, it was about assigning each card to a score and taking the userâ€™s card inputs
    to see if their score would win the game or bust.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a lab that I also enjoyed working on. In this lab it made it easy to
    understand the if statement and while statements. The objective of this lab was to create
    several if statements and for the program to loop until the user inputs the correct number
    that matches the secret number.
